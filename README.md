### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working at/for [rechnerherz](https://www.rechnerherz.at/) and [MediPrime](https://www.mediprime.eu/).
I used to work for and I still love [Stencyl](http://www.stencyl.com/).

I enjoy working with Java/Kotlin (preferably Kotlin), JavaScript/TypeScript (preferably TypeScript), and Spring.

When I can I contribute bug reports or fixes to Kotlin, Spring, or other libraries.

We have open sourced some of our code here:

- [spring-boot-kotlin-rest-api-template](https://github.com/rechnerherz/spring-boot-kotlin-rest-api-template): A state-of-the-art template for REST APIs written in Kotlin with Spring Boot.
- [aoprofiling-spring-boot-starter](https://github.com/rechnerherz/aoprofiling-spring-boot-starter): A Spring Boot starter for convenient aspect-oriented profiling in development.

Some of my projects from university are still here too:

- [pastry-push-sum](https://github.com/darioseidl/pastry-push-sum): An implementation of the Push-Sum protocol as a FreePastry application.
- [peersim-push-sum](https://github.com/darioseidl/peersim-push-sum): A comparison of the Push-Sum and Push-Pull protocols using the PeerSim network simulator. 

Back then, I created some extensions for Stencyl: [stencyl-extensions](https://github.com/darioseidl/stencyl-extensions).

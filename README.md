### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working for [rechnerherz](https://www.rechnerherz.at/) and [MediPrime](https://www.mediprime.eu/).
I used to work for and I still love [Stencyl](http://www.stencyl.com/).

I enjoy working with Java/Kotlin (preferably Kotlin), JavaScript/TypeScript (preferably TypeScript), and Spring.

We have open sourced some of our code here:

- [spring-boot-kotlin-rest-api-template](https://github.com/rechnerherz/spring-boot-kotlin-rest-api-template): A state-of-the-art template for REST APIs written in Kotlin with Spring Boot.
- [aoprofiling-spring-boot-starter](https://github.com/rechnerherz/aoprofiling-spring-boot-starter): A Spring Boot starter for convenient aspect-oriented profiling in development.

Some of my projects from university are still here too:

- [pastry-push-sum](https://github.com/darioseidl/pastry-push-sum): An implementation of the Push-Sum protocol as a FreePastry application.
- [peersim-push-sum](https://github.com/darioseidl/peersim-push-sum): A comparison of the Push-Sum and Push-Pull protocols using the PeerSim network simulator. 

Back then, I created some extensions for Stencyl: [stencyl-extensions](https://github.com/darioseidl/stencyl-extensions).

I collect some useful commands in [my Gists](https://gist.github.com/darioseidl).

I'm a big fan of (and a small volunteer at, when I find the time): [RefugeesCode](http://www.refugeescode.at/) / [EveryoneCodes](https://everyonecodes.academy/).

You can contact me at my first name 'at' rechnerherz.at. You can also take at look at my [Github pages](https://darioseidl.github.io/).
